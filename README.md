## Overview

`Desktop-Simulator-Open_GL` is a desktop simulation application that leverages OpenGL for rendering interactive graphical elements. This project demonstrates how to create a basic simulation environment, providing a platform for exploring OpenGL's capabilities and integrating various graphical libraries.

## Features

- **OpenGL Rendering:** Utilizes OpenGL for high-performance graphics rendering.
- **Interactive UI Components:** Includes interactive elements such as buttons, sliders, and other controls.
- **Real-Time Simulation:** Offers a real-time simulation environment for demonstration and testing.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed to work on multiple operating systems with minimal adjustments.

## Prerequisites

To build and run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **OpenGL:** Core graphical library for rendering.
- **GLFW:** Library for creating windows and handling user input. [GLFW Download](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- **GLAD:** OpenGL loader to manage OpenGL function pointers. [GLAD Download](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
- **CMake:** Build system generator. [CMake Download](https://cmake.org/download/)
- **GCC/Clang:** C++ compiler. Install via your package manager.
